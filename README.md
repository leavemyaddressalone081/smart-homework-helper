#Safe AI Homework Helper

An AI homework assistant that actually keeps things appropriate - blocks all the weird stuff students might try while helping with real schoolwork.

What It Does
- 💀 Filters out inappropriate content (violence, gore, hate speech, you name it!!!)
- 📚 Helps with all subjects - Math, English, Science, ANYTHING!
- 🎯 Very easy to understand(step-by-step style)
- 🗂️ Saves your chat history so you can review later
- 🕷️ Catches people trying to bypass filters with "l33tspeak" or weird spelling
- 🤖 Uses Google's FLAN-T5 model - runs locally, no API keys needed

How It Works
Built with Google's FLAN-T5 AI model that downloads straight to your computer!. The content filter goes through multiple systems to catch inappropriate stuff before it even gets to the AI Blocks almost everything (thats inappropriate)!.

Keeps responses formal and educational, so it's actually useful for homework instead of just messing around.

How to run it yourself!

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

⚠️ Remember:The First run takes 2-3 minutes while the AI model downloads. After that it's cached and loads almost instantly!

Created during the 8-Day AI Challenge - trying to make AI that's actually safe and useful for students without being annoying about it.
